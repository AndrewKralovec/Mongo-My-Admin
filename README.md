<h3> About </h3> 
When i first starting working with mongo, i hated it. It was usefully for simply json paresing, however i found it unstructured compaired with SQL. I thuoght i was hard to naviagate and i wished they had a admin page like phpmyadmin. So i decided to make such a application. I posted it to github, and you are free to use this application.I also apperaite any suggestions or features you think should be added. Thanks everyone
