<h3> About </h3> 
When i first starting working with mongo, i hated it. It was usefully for simply json paresing, however i found it unstructured compaired with SQL. I thuoght i was hard to naviagate and i wished they had a admin page like phpmyadmin. So i decided to make such a application. I posted it to github, and you are free to use this application.  

<h3> Start Mongo My Admin </h3>

Clone the project from github to your desired folder location. "git clone https://github.com/AndrewKralovec/Mongo-My-Admin.git" .
